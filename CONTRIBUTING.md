# Contribution Workflow & Assignment Rules

To keep contributions organized during open-source programs like **GSSoC** and avoid duplicate work, please follow these rules before starting work on any issue.

## Before You Start

* Do **not** start working on an issue until it has been assigned to you by a maintainer.
* Please avoid opening Pull Requests without prior assignment.
* Forking the repository is completely allowed, but unassigned PRs may be closed.

## Getting an Issue Assigned

* Comment on the issue with your implementation approach instead of only writing:

  * `"assign this issue to me"`
* Issues are generally assigned on a **first meaningful interaction** basis.
* Priority may be given to contributors who clearly demonstrate understanding of the issue.

## Assignment Limits

* Contributors may work on **one issue at a time** unless approved otherwise.
* If no meaningful progress or PR activity is shown within a few days, the issue may be reassigned.

## Pull Request Rules

* PRs must reference the related issue number.
* Duplicate PRs for already assigned issues are likely to be closed.
* Large feature additions should first be discussed in an issue before implementation.

## Maintainer Rights

Maintainers reserve the right to:

* reassign issues,
* close inactive assignments,
* reject unrelated or low-quality PRs,
* and enforce repository contribution standards.
